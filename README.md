# Concordia University Library Open Access Harvester
The Open Access Harvester starts with an xml list of numbered, bibliographic citations (say, from a CV), which has been parsed. The harvester uses the xml file as input, and identifies any citations published in journals where Sherpa/Romeo indicates that a "Publisher PDF" may be deposited in an institutional repository. After that the software will try to fetch the full text PDF. A report providing a summary as well as detailed information on each step is produced at the end.
